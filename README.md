# Sorting Phonebooks
This project allows the user to sort phonebooks by many different parameters such as name, PO Box, amount of vowels in name, most common address, and more through different Comparator<T> interfaces

MyVector is an augmented vector with a sort function

Student is a class that represents each individual in the phonebook and all of their information.

When compiled and executed, Question.java shows some examples as to how comparators can be used to sort the phonebook in different ways.
